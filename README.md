# hangman_Python

## Play a game of hangman.
## The game will choose a word from the supplied dictionary file,
## and you will be prompted to enter letters.
## If you guess wrong, then the hangman will be progressively drawn onscreen,
## until either you get the word, or the hangman is complete.

## Good luck!
